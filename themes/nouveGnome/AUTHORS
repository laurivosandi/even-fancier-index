ABOUT:

The nouveGnome icon theme is made by Pedram Pourang (aka Tsu Jan) in May 2010. It is NOT a complete icon set but depends on GNOME Desktop icon theme, which is provided by the package gnome-icon-theme in the Debian-based systems.

nouveGnome is inspired by A. Moore's nuoveXT and uses some of its icons. nuoveXT can be downloaded from:

The neat folder icon of GNOME-Colors is used in modified forms. The project home of GNOME-Colors is here:

Some other icons are made by editing or mixing GNOME and KDE project icons, which can be found in Debian and Ubuntu repositories.
