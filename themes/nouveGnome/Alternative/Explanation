You could use the icons in this folder instead of the default ones with light gray GTK+ themes, for example. I made them for GnomishGray. The corresponding "Extra" icons are also included.

To use these icons, you could simply copy all folders inside the current directory and merge them with their corresponding theme folders. Don't forget to update the icon cache afterward if you use it.
