Installation:

(1) Put this folder in '~/.icons/', i.e. in the hidden folder ".icons" in your home directory (create it if it doesn't exist);

(2) In GNOME3, you could update the icon cache with the following command in Terminal:

	gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 ~/.icons/nouveGnome

(3) In GNOME3, choose the theme from Advanced Settings > Theme > Icon Theme.

This is true for Debian-based systems, at least.

For alternative icons, see the explanation inside the folder "Alternative".

Read AUTHORS for more information.
